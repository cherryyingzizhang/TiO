TiO
===

TiO is an AirBnB-like android application. I developed it with another Android developer, a backend, and a UI designer at a Japanese hackathon. This app helps freelance creators and developers find free office space from companies.

Note: not polished, most of the UI is complete but the backend is lacking (made from Parse + only few entries in the database)
